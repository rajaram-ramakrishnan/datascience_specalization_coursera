Variability :

 Key measures of spread is variablity. We measure through variance or square root of that called standard deviation.
 SD is of same measure as population. If population is m , SD is m and variance is meter squared.
 
  Var(X) = E[(X-mu)^2] = E(X^2) - E(X)^2
  
  Sample Variance :
  
     Sum(Xi-X)^2/n-1
	 
	more nb of samples, less variance we tend to get
